# Game Design from a Beginner

Hello, random Internet person. You'll find here a collection of scripts, notes and errors that have guided me through learning game design. I have only recently started on my journey, and I welcome your prying eyes on my personal development. In terms of coding, I come from a mostly web background. I work professionally as a web developer, but I have a general knowledge of programming that should help me make sense of this new endeavour. I've only recently decided that perhaps I should see what the open source movement was like, and how I could contribute to it. I think that this could be a small step toward a greater insertion into the open source movement. If I were to embarass myself with absurd code patterns or offensive coding styles, please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks, have fun.
